## Dark-pool Data Analysis

  Dark pools are private venues that the investor can exchange large amount of stock there without impacting market price overly. 
  It is ubiquitous in modern trading. However, unlike traditional stock exchange, there is little transparency of trade execution and the information flow is asymmetric in dark pools. 
  Also unlike traditional stock exchange, current finance literatures show limited understanding about the inner working of dark pools. 
  Based on these motivations, we developed machine learning methods by exploiting asymmetric data to predict liquidity in dark pools trading.
